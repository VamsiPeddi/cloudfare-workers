# Cloudfare Serverless API and React JS Frontend

This is the javascript code for creating serverless api that serves blog platform. Users can submit the blogs using React JS based Frontend Website. The Frontend makes calls to CloudFare Workers api's which are serverless.

## Backend

### Getting started with Wrangler 

For the backend of this Blogging platform, we'll be using Cloudflare Workers to launch a serverless API which will allow the creation and storage of new posts, as well as distributing those posts to visitors of the site. To start, let's create a new Workers project with Wrangler 

### Installing Wrangler

To install wrangler: 

```bash
npm i @cloudflare/wrangler -g
```

### Authentication

To set up wrangler to work with your Cloudflare user, first you must create a free Cloudfare account and then use the following commands:

```bash
wrangler login
```
After successful login In wrangler.toml update account_id field with your account id that you get from running the command:

```bash
wrangler whoami
```
### ðŸ‘© ðŸ’» Developing

First you must generate the wrangler workers project. We have generated a project with typescript template:

```bash
wrangler generate my-ts-project https://github.com/cloudflare/worker-typescript-template
```

### KV 

Before we start implementing the api handlers we have to setup wrangler_kv - the key value storage system for Workers. 
Command to create kv 

```bash
wrangler kv:namespace create "MY_KV"
```
Add the following lines to wrangler.toml to finish KV-Store setup:

kv-namespaces = [
   { binding = "MY_KV", id = "<your_account_id>" }
]

After our KV is setup, we can begin to implement our api handlers. 


### Code Explanation: 

#### index.js - 
Will route the incoming requests to their respective handlers. 
#### titlelist.js - 
This function is invoked when user makes get request on <site>/posts/
This function checks in Cloudfare KV store to see if there is data. If not it just add 2 default records
If there is data in KV , It will fecth all keys and corresponding values and form a json  array and return to the client
we are also maintaining TotalPosts in KV. this is useful to add new POSTs
user invokes the https request http://127.0.0.1:8787/posts/
this program return [{"title":"My First Post","username":"coolguy123","content":"Hey Y'all!"},{"title":"Story About my Dogs","username":"kn0thing","content":"So the other day I was in the yard, and..."},{"title":"My 3rd Post","username":"coolguy134","content":"Hey Y'all!"},{"title":"My4th Post","username":"coolguy134","content":"Hey Y'all!"}]
   
#### posttile.js - 
 this function is invoked by client using POST request
 This function reqads totalposts and add 1 to it and write back totalpost into KV
 Also writes new data to KV
 Payload for post request should be as follows
     {
              "data" : {"title":"My 10th Post","username":"coolguy44444","content":"Hey Love Cloudfare KV"}
    }
   


### Publishing our pages

In order to deploy your serverless api you need to publish your worker with:

```bash
wrangler publish
```
Make sure you are logged in first

### Testing

To test your backend, you can run wrangler in dev mode or even in preview mode:
Dev Mode:

```bash
wrangler dev
```
Preview Mode: 

```bash
wrangler preview --watch
```

## Frontend

### Create React App 

First you must create a react project with:

```bash
npx create-react-app <appname>
```
From here you need to add required components and route them properly. 

### Adding bootstrap 

To use bootstrap css and make your webpages better looking, you need to install react-bootstrap:

```bash
npm install react-bootstrap@next bootstrap@5.1.3
```
Add the following code to your index.js or App.js to get CSS components: 

```bash
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```
   
### Code Explanation: 

#### app.js - Routes browser requests 

#### posts.js 
Make a GET  API call to  Cloudfare serverless API and displays all the posts 
   

#### simplepost.js 
Make a POST API call to  Cloudfare serverless API and posts user new blog content. 
      
   
Will route the incoming requests to their respective handlers. 
#### titlelist.js - 
   
### Running and Testing

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
